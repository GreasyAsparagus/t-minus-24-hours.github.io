    <p>Down syndrome is a common genetic condition that is estimated to affect over 400,000 people in the US alone. Often diagnosed at or before birth, Down syndrome is a lifelong condition that can affect appearance, physical and intellectual development, and susceptibility to other health conditions. In this competition, students will be presented with a scenario about someone living with Down syndrome. They will have 24 hours to research and come up with a creative, feasible solution to aid the person in their daily life. At the end of the 24 hours, the students will present their solution to a panel of judges for the chance to win up to $100.</p>
